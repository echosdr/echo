# Privacy Policy for Echo

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

I (Mark Garrison Jr.) built **Echo** to listen to radio signals, not to listen to you.

Here is exactly how your data is handled.

## 1. No Tracking, No Analytics
I do not know who you are, how you use the app, or what stations you listen to.
- **No Third-Party Analytics:** Echo does not contain Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, or any other tracking code.
- **No Ad Networks:** There are no advertisements in the app, and no data is sent to ad brokers.

## 2. Your Data is Yours
All your Favorites, History, Recordings, and settings are stored locally on your device.
- **Local Only:** Your data never leaves your device. There is no cloud backup, server sync, or remote storage of any kind.
- **Data Deletion:** Deleting the app from your device instantly removes all local data, including history, favorites, and recordings.
- **Coming Soon**: A future update may add optional iCloud sync for favorites and settings. If enabled, that data would be stored in your personal, encrypted iCloud container—never on Echo servers. You will always be able to keep everything local-only.

## 3. Connections to Radio Servers
When you connect to a KiwiSDR or OpenWebRX server, your device makes a direct network connection to that server.
- **IP Addresses:** The server owner may see your IP address in their connection logs. This is standard for how the internet works.
- **Echo's Role:** Echo acts only as a client (a browser). It does not send your identity or personal data to these servers, only the commands needed to tune the radio.

## 4. Location Data
Echo may ask for your location to show you the distance to radio servers.
- **On-Device Only:** Your location is processed instantly on your device to calculate distance. It is never saved to a database, never sent to a server, and never shared with anyone.

## 5. Microphone & Speech Recognition
Echo may request access to your microphone and speech recognition.
- **Microphone:** Used to process audio from the SDR stream for visualization and optional recording. Recordings are saved locally on your device and are never uploaded anywhere.
- **Speech Recognition:** If you enable transcription, Echo uses Apple's on-device speech recognition to generate live transcripts. The audio and transcripts stay on your device.
